# Minecraft_AI
Creating a AI capable of intelligently working in a voxel-based world (Minecraft).

Project to brush the dust and rust off my coding, or what's left of it.

Primary objective of the AI will be to survive, and after survival is to help others / build.
AI will not be aggressive, but will defend self.
Later on hope to research and implement self-learning algorithms, but need to KISS those goodbye for now.

Anyone is welcome to comment or suggest options or how to do something, but I'm sure that's not going to be for aWhile.
